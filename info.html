        <h2>about us!</h2>
        <p>We are a company dedicated to helping achieve sustainable fishing and
            fishers only fishing for what is safe and what they want to fish.<BR>
        EcoNett hopes to benefit everyone with its biodegradeable nets that https://www.epa.sa.gov.au/
        let animals that are not intended to be fished escape into their home. <BR>
        One of our goals is to also keep pricing down to be as accesible as possible.
        Fortunately, our biodegradeable material is cheaper than most rope nets available.<BR>
        This is a win-win, because we can save the enviornment and keep costs down. 
        
        <h2>Getting others convinced on our stance</h2>
        <p>How can we convince the public, government, fishermen and restaurant owners to use this net
         or accept fish only caught by a sustainable net. Well, we usually try to make<BR>
        our nets cheap enough to be preferred to buy, since it would save money. Many people still
        aren't aware of the devastating effects of plastic and non-biodegradeable material. <BR>
        They also can't get some sea creatures back into the ocean because they are stuck on the net.
        To solve this, we spread awareness on the Internet, billboards, and more! We also make <BR>
        our biodegradeable nets degrade in a few hours, to a few days depending on the model. <BR>
